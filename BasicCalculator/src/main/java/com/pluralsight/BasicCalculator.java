    //In these exercise you will create basic console applications which prompt the
    //user for information and then perform calculations based on the user input.
    //Remember to do your work in the workbook-1 directory.
    //Remember to be conscious of the format and readability of your code.
    //* Use meaningful variable names
    //* Use whitespace and lines to organize your code and thoughts so that
    //others can easily understand your code
    //* Don't try to do multiple things on a single line of code - when in doubt
    //opt for code readability
    //EXERCISE 3
    //Create a Java application named BasicCalculator that reads in two floating point
    //numbers and then asks the user whether they want to add, subtract, multiply or
    //divide the two numbers.
    //For this exercise, only code the questions. We wonâ€™t actually calculate add,
    //subtract, multiply or divide. For this exercise, always multiply.
    //Step 1
    //Perform the requested operation and display the results.
    //Enter the first number: 5
    //Enter the second number: 12
    //Possible calculations:
    //(A)dd
    //(S)ubtract
    //(M)ultiply
    //(D)ivide
    //Please select an option: M
    //5 * 12 = 60
